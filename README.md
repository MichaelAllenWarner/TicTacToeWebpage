# Mike's Tic-Tac-Toe Web App

This is the web-app version of the "Tic-Tac-Toe Plus" game that I [originally made for Node console](https://github.com/MichaelAllenWarner/tic-tac-toe) (like normal Tic-Tac-Toe except that you can choose the size of the board). It's [hosted on GitHub Pages](https://michaelallenwarner.github.io/tic-tac-toe-web-app/TicTacToe.html).

I programmed a rudimentary AI this time for a human-vs-computer option. I also put some effort into the UX&mdash;specifically, I used CSS transitions and pseudo-classes to make it "fun" to click and hover over the squares.

This was my last "spaghetti-code" project. The functionality is fine, but under the hood it isn't pretty. I've since learned how to modularize my JavaScript and bundle it with Webpack.
