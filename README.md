# Mike's Tic-Tac-Toe Web App

This is the web-app version of the "Tic-Tac-Toe Plus" game that I originally made for Node REPL (like normal Tic-Tac-Toe except that you can choose the size of the board). It isn't currently hosted anywhere, but there are no package dependencies, so if you want to try it just download the repository and open the HTML file in your browser.

I programmed a rudimentary AI this time for a human-vs-computer option. I also put some effort into the UX&mdash;specifically, I used CSS transitions and pseudo-classes to make it "fun" to click and hover over the squares.

This was my last "spaghetti-code" project. It works well, but it isn't pretty. I've since learned how to modularize my JavaScript and bundle it with Webpack.
